	- Added the ability to load localization data directly from a hash-ref, so data can
	  come from other sources except files (think databases).
	- The path paremeter to the new() constructor is now optional, as you can call the
	  (new) methods load_path() and load_structure() manually and as much as you want,
	  merging data from call to call. Backwards compatibility is kept.
	- Now using JSON instead of JSON::Any.
