                    }
            }

            # in your app
            use Locale::Wolowitz;

            my $w = Locale::Wolowitz->new( './i18n' );

            print $w->loc('Welcome!', 'es'); # prints 'Bienvenido!'

            print $w->loc("I'm using %1", 'he', $w->loc('Linux', 'he')); # prints "אני משתמש בלינוקס"

DESCRIPTION
    Locale::Wolowitz is a very simple text localization system, meant to be
    used by web applications (but can pretty much be used anywhere). Yes,
    another localization system.

    Frankly, I never realized how to use the standard Perl localization
    systems such as Locale::Maketext, Gettext, Data::Localize or whatever.
    It seems they are more meant to localize an application to the language
    of the system on which its running, which isn't really what I need. I
    want to allow users of my web applications (to put it simply, visitors
    of a website backed by one of my web apps) to view my app/website in the
    language of their choice. Also, I grew to hate the standard .po files,
    and thought using a JSON format might be more comfortable. And so
    Wolowitz was born.

    Locale::Wolowitz allows you to provide different languages to end-users
    of your applications. To some extent, this means you can perform
    language negotiation with visitors (see Content negotiation on Wikipedia
    <https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Content_neg
    otiation&oldid=367120431>).

    Locale::Wolowitz works with JSON files. Each file can serve one or more
    languages. When creating an instance of this module, you are required to
    pass a path to a directory where your application's JSON localization
    files are present. These are all loaded and merged into one big
    hash-ref, which is stored in memory. A file with only one language has
    to be named <lang>.json (where <lang> is the name of the language, you'd
    probably want to use the two-letter ISO 639-1 code). A file with
    multiple languages must end with .coll.json (this requirement will
    probably be lifted in the future).

    The basic idea is to write your application in a base language, and use
    the JSON files to translate text to other languages. For example, lets
    say you're writing your application in English and translating it to
    Hebrew, Spanish, and Dutch. You put Spanish and Dutch translations in
    one file, and since everybody hates Israel, you put Hebrew translations
    alone. The Spanish and Dutch file can look like this:

            # es_and_nl.coll.json
            {
                    "Welcome!": {
                            "es": "Bienvenido!",
                            "nl": "Welkom!"
                    },
                    "I'm using %1": {
                            "es": "Estoy usando %1",
                            "nl": "Ik gebruik %1"
                    },
                    "Linux": {}
            }

    While the Hebrew file can look like this:

            # he.json
            {
                    "Welcome!": "ברוכים הבאים!",
                    "I'm using %1": "אני משתמש ב%1",
                    "Linux": "לינוקס"
            }

    When loading these files, Locale::Wolowitz internally merges the two
    files into one structure:

            {
                    "Welcome!" => {
                            "es" => "Bienvenido!",
                            "nl" => "Welkom!",
                            "he" => "ברוכים הבאים!",
                    },
                    "I'm using %1" => {
                            "es" => "Estoy usando %1",
                            "nl" => "Ik gebruik %1",
                            "he" => "אני משתמש ב%1",
                    },
                    "Linux" => {
                            "he" => "לינוקס",
                    }
            }

    We can see here that Spanish and Dutch have no translation for "Linux".
    Since Linux is written "Linux" in these languages, they have no
    translation. When attempting to translate a string that has no
    translation to the requested language, or has no reference in the JSON
    files at all, the string is simply returned as is.

    Say you write your application in English (and thus 'en' is your base
    language). Since Locale::Wolowitz doesn't really know what your base
    language is, you can translate texts within the same language. This is
    more useful when you want to give some of your strings an identifier.
    For example:

            "copyrights": {
                    "en": "Copyrights, 2010 Ido Perlmuter",
                    "he": "כל הזכויות שמורות, 2010 עידו פרלמוטר"
            }

    As you've probably already noticed, Wolowitz supports placeholders. In
    Locale::Wolowitz, placeholders are written with a percent sign, followed
    by an integer, starting from 1 (e.g. %1, %2, %3). These are replaced by
    whatever you're passing to the "loc()" method (but make sure you're
    passing scalars, or printable objects, otherwise you'll encounter
    errors).

CLASS METHODS
  new( $path )
    Creates a new instance of this module. Requires a path to a directory in
    which JSON localization files exist. They will be automatically loaded.

OBJECT METHODS
  loc( $msg, $lang, [@args] )
    Returns the string $msg, translated to the requested language (if such a
    translation exists, otherwise no traslation occurs). Any other
    parameters passed to the method (@args) are injected to the placeholders
    in the string (if present).

INTERNAL METHODS
  _load_locales( $path )
    Loads all locale JSON files in the directory $path and returns them as a
    hash-ref.
